    <h3 class="blog-post-title">Daily Data Transfer & Cadence</h3>
    
    <p>All files must be in a single level atomic zip file named for the date <em>(YYYY-MM-DD)</em> and transferred at the same time daily either through a Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) or AWS S3 Sync. Bridg will provide the SFTP host. You will provide a public key for Bridg to attach to the SFTP. If youâ€™re using AWS S3 Sync, the files have to be pushed to our AWS infrastructure.</p>
