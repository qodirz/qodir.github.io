    <p>While you build out any necessary extract, transform, load processes (ETLs) to provide Bridg the data export, we will configure your account to prepare for data ingestion. To facilitate the configuration, please provide between one monthâ€™s worth of the files listed above, so we can run your data through a high-level validation process.</p>

    <h3>In addition to general QA, we need to know:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>What is the unique identifier for a transaction?</li>
        <li>How frequently are check IDs recycled (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)?</li>
        <li>Are check IDs unique across all stores?</li>
        <li>Will there be duplicates in the data, and if so, why?</li>
        <li>How many transactions per store per day?</li>
        <li>How late can data come in for a business date?</li>
        <li>What are all possible tender types and their IDs?</li>
        <li>What are all possible tender types details and their IDs?</li>
        <li>What are all possible order sources and their IDs?</li>
