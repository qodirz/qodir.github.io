    <h3 class="blog-post-title">Tender</h3>
    <p><strong>File name:</strong> <em>YYYY-MM-DD_tender.csv</em></p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The tender file is each individual charge. If a check is split three ways, there should be one check summary and three tender rows.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
        <p>The tender file has both <em>Tender Type</em> and <em>Detailed Tender Type</em>. Tender Type is an integer that we can use with the Tender Type dimension file. For example,</p>
        <ul>
        <li>1 =&gt; Cash</li>
        <li>2 =&gt; Credit Card</li>
        <li>3 =&gt; Gift Card</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>We also include an optional Detailed Tender Type, which allows us to do further segmentation on the specific tender type. For example,</p>
        <ul>
        <li>40 =&gt; Visa</li>
        <li>41 =&gt; Amex</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>If youâ€™re sending tokens as opposed to credit card last four, they have to unique across all customers and all stores.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
